Testing:

TestGit.java initializes, tests the functions of, and cleans up 2 different repos. To test a repo further, comment out the "repo(x).cleanup()" line, and the repo will stay created.

There are methods to find file paths by file name, remove files by file name, and remove directories by directory name in the MyRepo class. See comments for tips on how to use them and what parameters mean.
